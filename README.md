## Language processing in Arabic
Investigating how our statistical expectations affect how we read and process language

#### ~/corpus-analyses
Searched a database of 400K+ tokens to extract sentences with a specific type of sentence structure, and calculated descriptive summary statistics about the distribution of each sentence type in the dataset.\
Utilized the [Penn Arabic Treebank Part 3 v 3.2](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T08) (data not publicly available).

#### ~/exp1-self-paced-reading
Conducted an online self-paced reading experiment in which participants read sentences one word at a time at their own pace. Cleaned, preprocessed and analyzed reading time data to determine whether people read certain types of sentences faster than others. Demonstrated through statistical analyses and visuals that people read sentences faster when they are more expected versus when they are not.

#### ~/exp2-recall-task
Conducted an online task using Qualtrics in which participants read a sentence on one page, then re-wrote that sentence from memory on the following page. Cleaned, preprocessed and hand coded recall accuracy. Analyzed accuracy rates to determine whether people were more likely to correctly sentences that are more common than sentences that are less common.

#### ~/exp3-eye-tracking-UAE
Conducted an in-person eye tracking experiment in which participants read full sentences on a screen while a camera tracked their eye movements. Cleaned, preprocessed and analyzed eye movement data to determine whether people were more likely to re-read or read sentences for longer periods of time when they are unexpected.
