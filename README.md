## Language processing in Arabic
Investigating how our statistical expectations affect how we read and process language

#### ~/corpus-analyses
Searched a database of 400K+ tokens to extract sentences with a specific type of sentence structure, and calculated descriptive summary statistics about the distribution of each sentence type in the dataset.\
Utilized the [Penn Arabic Treebank Part 3 v 3.2](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2010T08) (data not publicly available).

#### ~/exp1-self-paced-reading
Conducted an online self-paced reading experiment in which participants read sentences one word at a time at their own pace. Cleaned, preprocessed and analyzed reading time data to determine whether people read certain types of sentences faster than others. Demonstrated through statistical analyses and visuals that people read sentences faster when they are more expected versus when they are not.
